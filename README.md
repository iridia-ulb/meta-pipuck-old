# The meta-pipuck layer for the Yocto build system
This repository contains a layer of the Yocto build system, which generates a complete, bootable Linux OS ready to be run on the Pi-Puck mobile robot. This layer provides three variants of the image for different use cases.

### `pipuck-image-base`
Provides a basic image with support for ARGoS. Well-suited for developing controllers using Lua.
### `pipuck-image-cpp`
Same as pipuck-image-base but with additional packages installed for on-robot C++ development (very slow). Provides a template C++ controller in the root user's home directory.
- ARGoS3 headers
- OpenCV
- GNU Compiler Collection (i.e., `gcc` and `g++` etc.)
- GNU Debugger (`gdb`)
### `pipuck-image-python`
Same as pipuck-image-base but with additional packages installed for on-robot Python development (untested)
- ARGoS3 headers
- OpenCV
- Python

## Quick start
We have listed two ways to build the system below. The reccomended method is to use Docker which will ensure a clean and predictable build environment. The only drawback of the Docker method is that you will need to use sudo or to switch user to root to use Docker. However, this is also a requirement for writing the built image to a SD card.

To get started, you need to decide where you want to build the system for the Pi-Puck. Keep in mind that while the resulting image will be approximately 1 GB in size, the build itself will require around **50 GB** of free disk space. In the following steps, we assume that the build location is ``/home/`id -un`/yocto-pipuck`` where `` `id -un` `` will be replaced with the current username.
```bash
# Create a directory for the build system
mkdir /home/`id -un`/yocto-pipuck
```

We now need to clone the layers for the build system as follows:
```sh
# Switch to the build location
cd /home/`id -un`/yocto-pipuck
# Clone the Yocto repository
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky --branch dunfell --single-branch
# Clone additional layers inside the Yocto repository
cd poky
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded --branch dunfell --single-branch
git clone https://github.com/allsey87/meta-pipuck.git
```

From this point, you can continue setting up the build environment on either your host system or inside a Docker container. However, unless you are running a cleanly installed and up-to-date version of Ubuntu, we strongly reccomend using the Docker-based method.

### The Docker way
The easiest way to build the system for the Pi-Puck is to use Docker. Given you have Docker installed, the following command will execute the Dockerfile in this repository and create a Docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The image will contain a user and a group, which match the current user and group. Setting the user and group enables trivial access to the build system from the host.
```sh
sudo docker build -t yocto-pipuck:latest https://github.com/allsey87/meta-pipuck.git#:docker \
 --build-arg host_usrid=`id -u` \
 --build-arg host_usrname=`id -un` \
 --build-arg host_grpid=`id -g` \
 --build-arg host_grpname=`id -gn`
```
Once the above command has completed sucessfully, you can run the following command to create a container from the image. Note the two paths given after the `-v` option. The format of this argument is `path/on/host:path/in/container` where `path/on/host` is a directory on your host system and `path/in/container` is a directory inside the Docker container. This command will map the home directory inside the container to a directory called `yocto-pipuck` under the current users home directory on the host.
```sh
sudo docker create --tty --interactive --volume /home/`id -un`/yocto-pipuck:/home/`id -un` \
 --name yocto-pipuck --hostname yocto-pipuck yocto-pipuck:latest
```
After executing this command, you should have a new container with the build environment. The following commands will start and attach to that container.

```
sudo docker start yocto-pipuck
sudo docker attach yocto-pipuck
```

### The manual way
These instructions assume you are running a clean, up-to-date installation of Ubuntu. If this is not the case, it is advisable to use the Docker solution above. 

The first step is to install the dependencies for the build system:
```sh
sudo apt install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect
 xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 tmux
```
Change the current directory to the build location
```sh
cd /home/`id -un`/yocto-pipuck
```
Initialize the build environment
```sh
TEMPLATECONF=meta-pipuck/conf source oe-init-build-env
```

## Building the image
Regardless of whether you used the Docker method or to manual method, you should now be in a directory called `build`. To build the entire image for the Pi-Puck, just run bitbake followed by the image type that you would like to build, for example, for the base image:
```sh
bitbake ${IMAGE_VARIANT}
```
Occasionally, the build can fail due to internet connectivity issues or due to an oversight in the dependency tree. These issues are normally resolved by just re-executing the command above.

## Copying the image
The most straightforward way to burn a bootable image to the SD card is to use `bmaptool` from Intel. On Ubuntu, this package can be installed with `sudo apt install bmap-tools`. Most distributions of Linux should have a similar package that can be installed.

To burn the image, you need to locate the output image from the build system and to identify the device to which you would like to copy the image. The output image files are called `${IMAGE_VARIANT}-raspberrypi0-wifi.wic.bz2` and `${IMAGE_VARIANT}-raspberrypi0-wifi.wic.bmap` should be located under `poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi0-wifi`. The device (probably an SD card) that you want to write to will usually be something like `/dev/sdX` or `/dev/mmcX`. The easiest way to find out is to inspect the output of `dmesg` before and after inserting the SD card into your computer. You will need to unmount the device before burning the image. Be careful not to write the image to the device where your OS is installed.

```sh
umount /dev/DEVICE*
sudo bmaptool copy PATH/TO/${IMAGE_VARIANT}-raspberrypi0-wifi.wic.bz2 /dev/DEVICE
```

## Booting the image and accessing the console
The easiest and most reliable way to get access to the Pi-Puck is by using the on-board serial-to-USB converter. You can then connect to the board using a terminal application such as Picocom as follows:
```sh
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSBX
```
Where `ttyUSBX` is the serial-to-USB converter. Check `dmesg` while attaching the cable to confirm that you have the right device. Note that to access the serial port, you will either have to (i) use `sudo`, (ii) switch to the root user or (iii) add yourself to the `dialout` group (do not forget to restart afterwards).

## Wifi configuration
The wireless connection is controlled using the `iwctl` command. This interactive command makes the process of connecting to a wireless network relatively painless. Once you are connected, the wireless network is saved on the Pi-Puck under `/var/lib/iwd/SSID.KEY_TYPE`. The network should automatically connect on boot and fetch an IP address using DHCP.
